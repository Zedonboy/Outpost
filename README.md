# Outpost

is a project for intellectuals(not only artists) to sell their ideas as NFTs.

How about a Nigerian buying Soviet Rocket schematics as NFTs, from a retired Russian Engineer.

## Why is this project important?

1. It will give independenve and control to content creator, they don't need to beg Medium, Youtube for payments, censorships.

2. Intellectuals can share ideas anonymously, imagine someone in russian helping ukrainians by selling vital info, while staying anonymous and decentralized.

3. This will open many market segments of whistle blowers.

Thats the idea.
